# Churn Classification Model

This repository contains the code and documentation for a machine learning project aimed at predicting customer churn using classification techniques. The project uses a dataset of customer information and behavior to build and evaluate various classification models.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue for many businesses, as retaining customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. This project seeks to develop a predictive model that identifies customers who are likely to churn, allowing the business to take proactive measures.

## Files in This Repository

- **Classification Model (Churn data).ipynb**: The Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
- **churn_data.csv**: The dataset used for this project (if applicable).
- **model_output.pkl**: The serialized model output for deployment or further analysis.

## Steps in the Project

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- **Loading Data**: The dataset is loaded and basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed.
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, outliers, and other data quality issues.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features and selecting relevant ones to improve model performance.

### 2. Model Building
- **Model Selection**: We experimented with several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting Machines.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Used techniques like Grid Search and Cross-Validation to optimize model performance.
- **Model Evaluation**: The models were evaluated using metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

### 3. Results and Findings
- **Best Model**: The Random Forest model outperformed other models with an accuracy of 85% and an AUC of 0.90.
- **Feature Importance**: The most significant features contributing to churn prediction were customer tenure, contract type, and monthly charges.
- **Recommendations**: Based on the model's findings, it is recommended to focus on customers with short tenure and high monthly charges to reduce churn.

### 4. Future Work
- **Model Deployment**: The next step would be to deploy the model in a real-time environment using Flask or a similar framework.
- **Further Optimization**: Exploring more advanced techniques such as deep learning models or ensemble methods.
